    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>I am an aspiring full stack web and mobile app developer. I am a very detail-oriented person who loves to build and modify high-quality physical and digital things. Problem solving is really rewarding for me and I have the acumen for it. I am always interested in learning new things and therefore value and persue on-going education. I also enjoy bicycling, swimming, and running for general fitness and life balance and as a means of engaging with the beauty of the outdoors. I absolutely love music and how it can augment your mood or bring you to a new one. Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy trying all different types of foods.</p>
          <p>I strive to always produce the best that I can with whatever I engage in and believe that if everyone adopted this attitude that the world would be a better and ever-improving place.</p>

        <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
          <p>I am originally from Stamford Connecticut and now reside part-time both in South Salem New York and Coventry Rhode Island. I would ultimately like to reside full-time in Rhode Island or some similar place with easy access to the ocean which is my most favorite and necessary place in the world to be near.</p>
          <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Connecticut.</p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
          <h3>Favorite hobbies</h3>
            <p>My favorite hobbies are learning software technologies, playing my upright bass, bicycling, and building or working on high-quality bicycles. My bass playing is currently on 'sabatical' while I devote more of my time to learning software development-related things.</p>
          <h3>Dream job</h3>
            <p>My dream job is to develop desktop and mobile-friendly applications that would allow users to accomplish things that are socially or personally important to them, and in a way which can only be provided by the technology available through the use of technologies related to the internet including the use of GPS information.</p>
          <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>During my undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Connecticut, I developed an interest in computer programming from exposure to it as part of various class projects. After graduating from the University of Connecticut, I utilized my engineering skills and programming interest and abilities, to design and perform kinematic analyses of noncircular gears and noncircular gear-driven mechanisms using independently written BASIC software and AutoCAD. I wrote data acquisition, editing, utility, and data processing software modules using DOS and Visual Basic for a mountain bike race timing service I created and for which my domain goodtiming.com was acquired. I gained some experience with Visual FoxPro programming and SQL while employed at Furman Selz in New York City. I further entertained my programming interest by taking several college classes in the Computer Information Systems program at Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island where I had some exposure to Visual Basic, SQL, Java, and web development. Following that, during subsequent employment, I authored a web site to service a yearly craftsman show which further underscored my interest in and curiosity about web development. I then decided to take several online courses covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and PHP which led to the development of the various class and personal projects indicated in this page: http://www.goodtiming.com/aboutme/. As a result of those classes and development projects, I have at least touched on many of the components of full stack development using PHP on the back end. I am currently enrolled in thinkful.com's Front End Web Development course to provide further structure to my knowledge and fill in any gaps that I have in my front end skills. </p>
          <h3>Favorite music</h3>
            <p>I generally like listening to classic rock most of the time. I enjoy most any kind of music though. I sometimes like to listen to soft Baroque music while studying. Some of my favorite non-mainstream types of music are Rockabilly, Western Swing, and Big Band/Swing.</p>
